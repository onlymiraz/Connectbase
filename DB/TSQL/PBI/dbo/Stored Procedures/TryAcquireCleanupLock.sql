-- selects back 0 if lock NOT acquired
-- selects back 1 if lock acquired
-- Acquires a lock that governs the nightly cleanup (defaults to 2am) for the db.
-- this is done to keep scaleout farms from blocking each other, as each RS in a scaleout
-- farm  invokes the same cleanup job at the same time
-- IMPLEMENTATION: success updates the CleanupLock table with the specified machine name and time
-- lock is held for 8 hours
-- repeated calls from the same machine will all succeed
